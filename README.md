# feature maps augmenation 

Here you can find the code and jupyter notebook accompanying the post [Data augmentation of  convolutional feature maps](http://mtdat.blogspot.com/2017/02/data-augmentation-of-convolutional.html).
The notebook uses the train set of Kaggle's [Dogs vs. Cats dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data). 
If you would like to experiment with notebook you need to put train images into ../data/train directory. 
You can dowload the train set from the competition website.
